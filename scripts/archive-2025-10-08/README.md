# Archived Scripts (Pre-October 8, 2025)

This folder contains scripts that were created before October 8, 2025 and are no longer actively used. They're kept for historical reference and can be safely deleted if space is needed.

## Why Archived

These scripts were either:
- One-time migrations or fixes that have been completed
- Replaced by better implementations
- Made obsolete by changes to the data model
- Experimental scripts that weren't adopted

## Scripts in This Archive

Most of these scripts are related to:
- Initial database setup and migrations
- Early SportMonks API testing
- Team slug migrations
- Competition mapping setup
- One-time data fixes

## Safe to Delete?

âœ… **Yes, these scripts can be deleted** if you need to clean up space. They're not used in production or development workflows.

Before deleting, you might want to:
1. Review git history if you need to understand past decisions
2. Check if any contain useful patterns for future scripts
3. Verify no GitHub Actions or documentation references them

## If You Need to Reference

```bash
# Search for specific functionality
grep -r "specific_function" scripts/archive-2025-10-08/

# View script contents
cat scripts/archive-2025-10-08/script-name.mjs
