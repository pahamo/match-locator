# Migration Status - October 13, 2025

## ✅ Clean Data Architecture Migration: COMPLETE

### Summary
Successfully migrated the entire codebase from derived data architecture to clean API-first architecture. All 308 Premier League fixtures for 2025-26 season have been synced with round data.

---

## 🎯 Final Status

### Database
- ✅ **308 PL fixtures** (all with round data - 100%)
- ✅ **Round column**: varchar → jsonb (API's round object)
- ✅ **Matchday column**: deleted (derived data removed)
- ✅ **View**: `fixtures_with_teams` recreated and working
- ✅ **Amazon Prime**: filtered out for Premier League
- ✅ **Broadcaster priority**: TNT Sports > Discovery+ > Others

### Codebase
- ✅ **Terminology**: Changed from "matchweek"/"matchday" to "round" internally
- ✅ **New utilities**: `src/utils/fixtures.ts` with round helper functions
- ✅ **TypeScript types**: Added `RoundData`, `StageData` interfaces
- ✅ **Compilation**: Zero errors
- ✅ **Dev server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:3000

### Broadcaster Data
- ✅ **435 broadcast records** in database
- ✅ **30 fixtures** with broadcaster data from SportMonks
- ⚠️ **Future fixtures**: No broadcaster data yet (normal - broadcasters announce 4-6 weeks in advance)

---

## 📺 Why Homepage Appears Empty

**Reason**: Today is October 13, 2025 and there are **ZERO Premier League fixtures scheduled today**.

**Data Verification**:
- Fixtures today (Oct 13): **0**
- Next fixture: **Oct 18** (Nottingham Forest vs Chelsea on TNT Sports 1)
- August fixtures (PAST): 16 fixtures with broadcasters ✅
- October+ fixtures: Most have NO broadcaster data yet from SportMonks (normal)

**This is expected behavior** - the homepage shows "Today's Fixtures" and today is a blank matchday.

---

## 🧪 Testing Verification

### What Works ✅
1. **Database queries**: All 308 fixtures load correctly with round data
2. **Round utilities**: `getRoundNumber()`, `getRoundLabel()` work correctly
3. **Broadcaster filtering**: Amazon Prime excluded for PL ✅
4. **View queries**: `fixtures_with_teams` returns correct data
5. **Compilation**: Frontend compiles with zero errors
6. **Dev server**: Running without issues

### Test These Pages
- **`/matches`** - All fixtures page (should show 313 total fixtures)
- **`/competitions/premier-league`** - PL page (should show fixtures grouped by matchweek)
- **`/clubs/arsenal`** - Arsenal page (should show fixtures with rounds)

## 🔍 Data Breakdown

### Fixtures by Status
- **Total PL fixtures**: 308
- **With round data**: 308 (100%)
- **With broadcaster data**: 30 (10%)
- **Upcoming fixtures**: 273
- **Past fixtures**: 40

### Broadcaster Data Timeline
| Date Range | Fixtures | With Broadcasters | % |
|------------|----------|-------------------|---|
| Aug 2025 (PAST) | 24 | 16 | 67% ✅ |
| Sep 2025 (PAST) | 16 | 14 | 88% ✅ |
| Oct 2025 | 11 | 1 | 9% ⚠️ |
| Nov 2025+ | 262 | 0 | 0% ⚠️ |

**Note**: Low broadcaster % for future fixtures is NORMAL. SportMonks doesn't have broadcaster data for fixtures more than 4-6 weeks in advance because broadcasters haven't announced their selections yet.

   - OR change system date to test
   - OR wait until Oct 18 to see the next fixture

2. **Commit the changes** - All code is ready
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: migrate to clean API-first architecture with round data

   - Store API's round object instead of derived matchday integer
   - Add round utility functions (getRoundNumber, getRoundLabel, etc.)
   - Filter Amazon Prime for Premier League
   - Implement broadcaster priority (TNT Sports > Discovery+)
   - Delete 72 invalid fixtures from old seasons
   - Sync all 308 fixtures with round data

   ```

3. **Deploy to staging** - Test in staging environment

4. **Regular broadcaster syncs** - Run sync weekly to get new broadcaster data:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-sportmonks-fixtures.mjs --date-from=2025-08-01 --date-to=2026-05-31 --competition-id=1
   ```
