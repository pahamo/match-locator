# Deployment Summary - October 14, 2025

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

### Critical Issues Fixed

#### 1. ‚úÖ Column Aliasing Bug (DEPLOYED)
**Problem:** Competition pages showed no fixtures due to database column mismatch
- Database view uses: `home_team_slug`, `away_team_slug`
- Code was querying: `home_slug`, `away_slug`

**Fix:**
- Updated `supabase-simple.ts` with correct PostgREST alias syntax
- Format: `home_slug:home_team_slug` (alias:actual_column)
- Commit: `df7c8c84`

**Status:** ‚úÖ LIVE on production

---

#### 2. ‚úÖ Competition Page Logic (DEPLOYED)
**Problem:** Only showed 3 games when matchweek partially complete

**Fix:**
- Changed logic to show current + next matchweek (min 15 fixtures)
- Dynamic title: "Matchday X" or "Matchdays X-Y"
- Results tab shows most recent completed matchweek
- Commit: `11988e35`

**Status:** ‚úÖ LIVE on production

---

#### 3. ‚úÖ Admin Terminology Clarity (DEPLOYED)
**Problem:** UI said "Matchweek" but database uses "round"

**Fix:**
- Renamed `matchweekFilter` ‚Üí `roundFilter`
- Updated all labels: "Matchweek" ‚Üí "Round"
- Table header: "MW" ‚Üí "Round"
- Commit: `e475c144`

**Status:** ‚úÖ LIVE on production

---

## üìä Data Sync Results

### Today's Manual Sync (Oct 14, 2025)

| Competition      | Fixtures | New | Updated | Duration |
|-----------------|----------|-----|---------|----------|
| Premier League  | 302      | 0   | 302     | 226s     |
| Champions League| 171      | 0   | 171     | 173s     |
| FA Cup          | 94       | 0   | 94      | 133s     |
| EFL Cup         | 81       | 25  | 56      | 129s     |
| **TOTAL**       | **648**  | **25** | **623** | **661s** |

### Current Database Status

**Premier League 2025-26:**
- Fixtures: 313 (out of 380 expected)
- Missing: 67 fixtures (17.6%)
- With broadcaster: 30 (9.6%)
- TBD: 283 (90.4%)

**Why incomplete?**
- SportMonks API only has 302 fixtures available
- Missing fixtures haven't been scheduled by Premier League yet
- This is normal - early season fixtures scheduled incrementally
- Auto-sync will fetch them as they're announced

**All Competitions:**
- Total fixtures: 648
- Total UK broadcasts: ~435
- Clean round data: 100% (jsonb from API)
